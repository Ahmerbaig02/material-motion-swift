// This example shows how to connect a target/selector-based event system to MotionObservable.
// There are two concepts introduced here: Source and Producer.

// A source is the beginning of a stream. It produces events by connecting one system to another.
// The source we create here will allow someone to subscribe to UITapGestureRecognizer events, so
// we'll call it tapSource.

// vents and sends them through the provided observerâ€™s channels.
